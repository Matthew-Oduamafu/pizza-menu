# React Pizza Menu

Welcome to my "React Pizza Menu" project! This project was created to help me learn React from scratch. Below, you'll find an overview of what I've learned and implemented in this project.

## Project Overview

This React project showcases a pizza menu with various pizza options. Users can interact with the menu, view pizza details, and place orders. While the pizza list is not dynamic in this version, it still serves as a great foundation for future enhancements.

## What I've Learned and Used

- **React Components:** The project is built using multiple React components, making it easy to manage and maintain the UI.

- **JSX (JavaScript XML):** JSX simplifies the process of writing UI components by allowing me to mix HTML-like tags with JavaScript.

- **Props:** I've leveraged props to pass data between parent and child components, making the application more modular and reusable.

- **Conditional Rendering:** I've implemented conditional rendering to display pizza details when selected by the user.

- **State Management:** React state is used to manage the pizza selection and order placement.

- **CSS Styling:** The project features CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the menu.
